# My very first webpage

welcome!

This is a webpage project created as part of my course using HTML and CSS and 
created in the *cloud9* editor. A webpage was constructed containing four 
technology logos and four links to their wikipedia page, this process is 
repeated across two additional pages.

Three seperate *html* files were created in the project directory of *cloud9*.
Each of the three pages are linked with the creation of the *nav* element and 
each contain a heading called *stream* and are numbered from one to three.

*a href* and *src* attributes were utilised for the links and the logos.

Lastly, to add styles to the webpages a *css* folder was created in the 
project directory containing a *style.css* file. From here all the styles were 
applied to the webpages.
